      <h5>OSPF Example</h5>
	  <p><b>OSPF is an interior gateway routing protocol that uses link states rather than distance vectors for path selection. OSPF propagates link-state advertisements rather than routing table updates. Because only LSAs are exchanged instead of the entire routing tables, OSPF networks converge more quickly than RIP networks.</p>

<p>OSPF uses a link-state algorithm to build and calculate the shortest path to all known destinations. Each router in an OSPF area contains an identical link-state database, which is a list of each of the router usable interfaces and reachable neighbors.</p>

<p>The advantages of OSPF over RIP include the following:</p>

<p>OSPF link-state database updates are sent less frequently than RIP updates, and the link-state database is updated instantly rather than gradually as stale information is timed out.</p>

<p>Routing decisions are based on cost, which is an indication of the overhead required to send packets across a certain interface. The ASA calculates the cost of an interface based on link bandwidth rather than the number of hops to the destination. The cost can be configured to specify preferred paths.</p>

<p>The disadvantage of shortest path first algorithms is that they require a lot of CPU cycles and memory.</p></b>
