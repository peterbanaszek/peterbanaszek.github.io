<!-- A/C Maintenance Details -->
	  <span class="guidepost">A/C Backup</span>
	  <p>The backup A/C serves a vital role in the TMC. In a situation where the main Enviromux A/C fails, the backup unit will engage to prevent the server racks from overheating. This regular testing verifies that the backup A/C is functioning properly. The description below will cover all the necessary steps involved with carrying out the monthly maintenance.</p>
	  
      <br>1. Locate the A/C control panel in the server room
      <br>2. Press the button to switch the fan from AUTO to ON 
	  <br>3. Lower the temperature from 72째 to 68째

	  <p>This will cause the backup A/C to come on and the Liebert A/C will automatically shut down, which should also happen if the main A/C ever fails. As a result an alarm will go off notifying the TMC personnel that the backup A/C has come on. It is up to the operator on duty to clear the alarm off the overhead view screen. As a general practice, TMC personnel should let the backup A/C run for an entire shift or at least 8 hours. After the testing is complete, the backup A/C should be turned off and the main A/C should be restored. The steps involved are as follows.</p>

	  <br>1. Locate the A/C control panel in the server room<
      <br>2. Press the button to switch the fan from ON to AUTO 
	  <br>3. Increase the temperature from 68째 to 72째 
	  <br>4. Enter 10.2.1.53 in Internet Explorer to login to the A/C GUI
      <br>5. Username: root Password: admin 
	  <br>6. Locate the Summary tab 
	  <br>7. Look for and click on Liebert On/Off 
	  <br>8. Set Output to Close and then hit Apply

	  <p>That will conclude all steps involved with A/C backup testing.</p>

<!-- Radio Maintenance Details -->	  
	  <span class="guidepost">Drain Two-Way Radios</span>
	  <p>TMC personal may need to communicate with personnel that are out in the field via Two-Way Radio. In an effort to maintain the reliability of the Two-Way Radios we must regularly drain the batteries and test their functioning. The operator is to active all radios and let them run until they are completely drained. Once that has been completed they must be recharged. Please report any issues to the supervisor.</p>
