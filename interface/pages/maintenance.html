      <span class="guidepost">A/C Backup Steps</span>

	  <p>The backup A/C serves a vital role in the TMC. In a situation where the main Enviromux A/C fails, the backup unit will engage to prevent the server racks from overheating. This regular testing verifies that the backup A/C is functioning properly. The description below will cover all the necessary steps involved with carrying out the monthly maintenance.</>
	  
      <h4>1. Locate the A/C control panel in the server room</h4>
      <h4>2. Press the button to switch the fan from AUTO to ON</h4>
	  <h4>3. Lower the temperature from 72째 to 68째</h4>

	  <p>This will cause the backup A/C to come on and the Liebert A/C will automatically shut down, which should also happen if the main A/C ever fails. As a result an alarm will go off notifying the TMC personnel that the backup A/C has come on. It is up to the operator on duty to clear the alarm off the overhead view screen. As a general practice, TMC personnel should let the backup A/C run for an entire shift or at least 8 hours. After the testing is complete, the backup A/C should be turned off and the main A/C should be restored. The steps involved are as follows.</p>

	  <h4>1. Locate the A/C control panel in the server room</h4>
      <h4>2. Press the button to switch the fan from ON to AUTO</h4>
	  <h4>3. Increase the temperature from 68째 to 72째</h4> 
	  <h4>4. Enter 10.2.1.53 in Internet Explorer to login to the Enviromux</h4> 
      <h4>5. Username: root Password: admin</h4>  
	  <h4>6. Locate the Summary tab</h4> 
	  <h4>7. Look for Liebert On/Off which should be red and set to open</h4>  
	  <h4>8. Wait for main A/C to turn on and look for alarm to clear out</h4> 
	  <h4>9. If the Liebert strobe is still on after the main A/C comes back on you must acknowledge the alarm within the Enviromux</h4>

	  <p>That will conclude all steps involved with A/C backup testing.</p>

	  <span class="guidepost">Drain Two-Way Radios</span>
	  <p>TMC personal may need to communicate with personnel that are out in the field via Two-Way Radio. In an effort to maintain the reliability of the Two-Way Radios we must regularly drain the batteries and test their functioning.
	  
	  <h4>1. Activate all radios and let them run until they are completely drained</h4>
	  <h4>2. Recharge drained radios</h4>
	  <h4>3. Report any issues to the supervisor</h4>
